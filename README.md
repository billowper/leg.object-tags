# Object Tags System
A data-driven, rule based object tag system for Unity/

* Objects have a set of tags
* When two objects interact (collision, triggers, script) a set of rules is evaluated and tags will be added or removed (if self "Burning" Add "Hot" to other)
* Rules can also be evaluated continuously (e.g. if self "Wet", remove "Burning")
* Various components for conditional objects, material properties, physics settings and so on
* Filters for triggers etc

Not really ready for public consumption, but I plan to make sample project soon!
